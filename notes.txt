In the last step, we created a relationship() column in the Department model. However, we have not yet specified which rows of the Employee are associated with a particular row of Department. To cater to this problem, we will add a backref argument to the relationship() function.

In the snippet given above, on line #4, we added a backref argument equal to 'department'. What this back-reference means is that a virtual variable department will be created in the Employee table. This way, we can refer to it by employee.department.

ðŸ’­ You might wonder why we need a back-reference when we already have the ForeignKey() column in the User table?
Yes, we already have a foreign key. However, that only gives us the name column of the department row. The backref that we created in a department will act as a virtual column in the user table containing the whole row of the department.
